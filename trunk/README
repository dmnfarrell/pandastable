ABOUT

Pandas is an open source Python library providing high-performance data structures 
and data analysis tools. Tkinter is the standard GUI toolkit for python. The pandastable
library provides a GUI frontend to the pandas DataFrame class. It is intended for the
following uses:
-for developers who want to include a table in their application that can store and process
large amounts of data
-for non-programmers who are not familiar with Python or the pandas API and want to use
the included table viewer application to manipulate/view their data
-it may also be useful for programmers who want to get an interactive look at their dataframes
A sample application using these classes is included in the distribution.
